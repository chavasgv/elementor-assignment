1. In the AWS environment I would have implemented it with a labmda function that will be trigered every time a url_list would be uploded to s3 bucket. the db would be any kind of RDS.
2. I could not find any 'categories' tag in the url api. 

instractions:
1.Update sql connect parameters in config file.
2.Update your apikey in config file
3.Update url_file path in config file
