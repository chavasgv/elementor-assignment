1. In the AWS environment I would have implemnted it with a labmda function that will be trigered every time a url_list would be uploded to s3 bucket. the db would be any kind of RDS.
2. I could not find any 'categories' tag in the url api. 
3. Had problems accessing sql with python in my current environmant setup. and run out of time...  :-(
